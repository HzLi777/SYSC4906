# SYSC 4906 - Introduction to Machine Learning

**Instructor:** Dr. James R. Green

**Teaching Assistants:** Kevin Dick & Daniel Kyrollos

This reposotory contains all of the teaching materials used in the Fall 2020 offering of the course and to implement a new curriculum design for introducing students to applied research.

An engineering education article describing the curriculum design is to appear in the proceedings of the [2021 SPLASH-E conference](https://2021.splashcon.org/track/splash-2021-SPLASH-E) with the title: **Machine Learning Pedagogy to Support the Research Community** 


## Abstract

 Machine learning methods are increasingly leveraged in disparate domains of research. As part of this course offering, we introduce a curriculum design to introduce undergraduate students to applied research through a series of course assignments and a competition among peers to inspire other educators. The course structure tailors assignments to a selected open research question while developing student understanding of machine learning. This repository contains the materials provided to students for the selected COVID19-related course-long problem of predicting which drugs might interact with specific proteins. We leveraged state-of-the-art tools for representing drug and protein sequences and challenged students to develop unique solutions competitive with a current state-of-the-art model using reproducible Notebooks and cloud-based computing resources with the expectation that top-ranking solutions would be used to predict novel druggable targets within the SARS-CoV-2 proteome to possibly treat COVID19 patients. We motivate this curriculum design based on related competition frameworks that have led to notable research advancements and contributed to machine learning pedagogy. From our experience, the top student solutions were ultimately combined using a stacked classifier to create a publishable solution representing an actual research contribution. We highly recommend introducing undergraduate students to open research applications early in their program to encourage them to consider pursuing a career in research.

## Introduction & Motivation



## For Educators

All of the **tutorial slides** and related **Notebooks** are listed within this directory, templated with the naming convention `T<tutorial_number>_<tutorial_topic(s)>.pdf`.

An acccompanying **YouTube series of recorded videos** for several of these tutorials is available [within Kevin Dick's YouTube Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ4pMPu3p7Xty97xU9HbOKdUE7RrJDStR).

The Assignement materials implementing our applied research curriculum design are available within the `Assignments` subdirectory.
